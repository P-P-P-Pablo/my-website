        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <p>My name is Pablo and I'm a web developer who's all about having a good time. When I'm not coding away,
            you can usually find me gaming, playing board games, or hanging with my friends. Cooking and movies are
            also a big part of my life, but I try to steer clear of horses (idk why they hate me) and working out.
            If you're a cat person, we already have something in common.</p>

        <p>My background is a little unconventional. I started out studying chemistry in hopes of making all the
            candies I could ever want, but eventually realized that water management was a more ethical and
            environmentally-friendly path. I've had a variety of jobs, including working in restaurants,
            construction, and even childcare. But my hobby of writing novels and articles led me to coding, and I
            fell in love with it.</p>
        <p>I honed my skills at Human Booster and the Wild Code School, and got my feet wet with a traineeship at
            360Medics. My most recent gig was as an Industry 4.0 Analyst, but now I'm on the hunt for a new
            challenge that's both fun and fulfilling.</p>
